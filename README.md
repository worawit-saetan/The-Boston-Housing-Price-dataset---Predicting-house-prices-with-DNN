# The-Boston-Housing-Price-dataset---Predicting-house-prices-with-DNN

We â€™ll build a deep neural network model to predict house prices (scalar regression problem)

## The outline is as follows

*   load the boston_housing dataset from Keras 
*   do feature normalization
*   build the deep neural network model
*   validate the model using K-fold validation (small validation set)
*   find the proper number of epochs (hyperparameter tuning)
*   plot the validation metrics (MAE)
*   retrain the model with all training data (including validation data) 
*   evaluate the model with test data
